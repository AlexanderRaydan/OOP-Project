Throughout the development of the "General Healthcare Facility Pre-Triage Application," 
I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in C++, especially 
regarding class design and inheritance. Implementing classes for managing patients, 
utilizing polymorphism, and handling dynamic memory allocation provided practical 
insights into these concepts.

One of the main challenges I faced was managing memory effectively to prevent memory 
leaks and ensure program stability. By carefully implementing copy constructors, 
copy assignment operators, and destructors, I was able to address this challenge and 
maintain proper memory management throughout the application. Additionally read and 
write a file with 3 types of information depend of the class, Time, TriagePatient 
and TestPatient.
